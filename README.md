# MACHINE-TRANSLATION-USING-AI
Machine translation is from the broad area of Artificial Intelligence. Machine Translation pertains to translation of one natural language to other by using automated computing. 
Our main goal is to introduce the concept of machine translation for the conversion of languages to minimize the use of human resources and to obtain the results in desired language in less time.
Our project aims to convert the source language to many target languages. (a text from a source language to its counterpart in a target language.)
Machine translation helps the people to
understand the information of unknown language without the
help of Human translator.
The machine translation process for language conversion can be done by 
Decoding the source language & then re-encoding in into the target language using NMT & SEQUENCE TO SEQUENCE MODEL.

Machine translation helps the people to understand the information of unknown language without the help of Human translator with minimum use of human resources.
